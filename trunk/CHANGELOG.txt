JPublish 4 change log:

[2007.05.28]
- WEB-INF/lib folder is not anymore required when JPublish is instantiated
  from an application different than a standard Servlet container.
- JPublish understands now how Jetty plays with the Continuations ;)
- latest PostEdenLib is now available in the lib folder
- added the latest bsh version
- DWR library is updated now and Reverse AJAX finally works with no problems.
- JP4+DWR is running successfully with the following servers: Jetty 5/6.1.3,
  Tomcat 5/6.0.13 and JBoss 4.0.2/4.0.5GA

[2007.05.20]
 - improving the JPublishComponent API in order to support
   the need for rendering a Text parameter or a View from a given path. Useful if
   you need to implement more complex Components but not as complex as a ViewRenderer.

 - Initial release
