h2(fred). This is a title

h3. This is a subhead

This is some text of dubious character. Isn't the use of "quotes" just lazy writing -- and theft of 'intellectual property' besides? I think the time has come to see a block quote.

bq. This is a block quote. I'll admit it's not the most exciting block quote ever devised.

Well, that went well. How about we insert an <a href="/" title="watch out">old-fashioned hypertext link</a>? Will the quote marks in the tags get messed up? No!

Some more text of dubious character. Here is a noisome string of CAPITAL letters. Here is something we want to _emphasize_. 
That was a linebreak. And something to indicate *strength*. Of course I could use <em>my own HTML tags</em> if I <strong>felt</strong> like it.

h3. Coding

This <code>is some code, "isn't it"</code>. Watch those quote marks! Now for some preformatted text:

*arse*<pre>
<code>
	$text = str_replace("<p>%::%</p>","",$text);
	$text = str_replace("%::%</p>","",$text);
	$text = str_replace("%::%","",$text);

</code>
</pre>

This isn't code.


So you see, my friends:

* The time is now
* The time is not later
* The time is not yesterday
* We must act
