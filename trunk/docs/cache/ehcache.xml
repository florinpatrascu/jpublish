    <!-- Sample cache named defaultCache
        This cache contains a maximum in memory of 10000 elements, and will expire
        an element if it is idle for more than 5 minutes and lives for more than
        10 minutes. Exxample:
        timeToIdleSeconds="300"
        timeToLiveSeconds="600"

        If there are more than 10000 elements it will overflow to the
        disk cache, which in this configuration will go to wherever java.io.tmp is
        defined on your system. On a standard Linux system this will be /tmp"
