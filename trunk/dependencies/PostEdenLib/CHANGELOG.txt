EdenLib change log:


[2007.08.25]
 - added the patch from Jakub Labath. Removing a child node after was added is
   working now.

2007.05.25
 - XML parsers can be specified in an external properties file. 
   The file named: edenlib-config.properties, has to be in the classpath of
   your web application and can contain:

	org.xml.sax.parser=com.bluecast.xml.Piccolo
	namespaces=off

   , where org.xml.sax.parser can be any valid xml parsing library available in the
   classpath. And where the namespaces can be turned on or off
   You can substitute the XML parser easily by adding the path to this properties
   file. Example of a PostEdenLib configured to use Xerces:

    #org.xml.sax.parser=com.bluecast.xml.Piccolo
	org.xml.sax.parser=org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser
	namespaces=off
   
   More than, that, if the user does not specify any parsing preferences, PostEdenLib will
   default to the fast Piccolo parser. If Piccolo is not in the path or the user is making 
   a config mistake, PostEdenLib will default to the XML parser supported by the system.

 - we need to refactor a bit the SAXConfigurationFactory.java class so we'll have a nicer
   initialization strategy.
 - making provisions for PostEdenLib 1.5.4
