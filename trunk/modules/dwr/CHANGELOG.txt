CHANGELOG

[2008.07.23]
 - JPublishDWR  Actions will receive now all of the traditional JPublish objects in the context:

    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_REQUEST
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_RESPONSE
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_SESSION
    JPublishCreator.APPLICATION
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_CHARACTER_ENCODING_MAP
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_URL_UTILITIES
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_DATE_UTILITIES
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_NUMBER_UTILITIES
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_SYSLOG
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_SITE

however, we are also cleaning the context so they are not accidentally sent to the remote caller.

- minor JPublishDWR revision number increased.




[2007.10.31]
 - the JPublishContext received by the Actions from the JPublishCreator contains now more useful
   objects. They are as follows:

    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_REQUEST
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_RESPONSE
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_SESSION
    JPublishCreator.APPLICATION
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_CHARACTER_ENCODING_MAP
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_URL_UTILITIES
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_DATE_UTILITIES
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_NUMBER_UTILITIES
    JPublishCreator.DWR_CURRENT_PAGE

[2007.10.27]
 - added functionality to allow DWR to invoke JPublish Actions. Check the simpleDWR
   web demo for a simple but complete example.

[2007.06.11]
 - all good, bugs fixed. We are using the latest DWR version:)

[2007.05.21]
 - rolled back DWR to 2.0 due to a problem I discovered with the reverse Ajax and this module.
   I am debugging it right now, check this file for further updates.
 - a better shutdown procedure, the cometd poll is clean properly now when the Servlet shuts down.
 - added a jetty script that can be used to start Jetty 5.1.x
