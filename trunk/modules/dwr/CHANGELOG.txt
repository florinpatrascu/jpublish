CHANGELOG

[2007.05.21]
 - rolled back DWR to 2.0 due to a problem I discovered with the reverse Ajax and this module.
   I am debugging it right now, check this file for further updates.
 - a better shutdown procedure, the cometd poll is clean properly now when the Servlet shuts down.
 - added a jetty script that can be used to start Jetty 5.1.x
