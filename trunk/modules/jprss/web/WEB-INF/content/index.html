<h3>JPublish-ROME integration DEMO &amp; TEST</h3>

<div id="page-title">ROME includes a set of parsers and generators for the various flavors of syndication
   feeds, as well as converters to convert from one format to another. The parsers can 
   give you back Java objects that are either specific for the format you want to 
   work with, or a generic normalized SyndFeed class that lets you work on with the data 
   without bothering about the incoming or outgoing feed type.
