This is the JPublish-RSS module; JPRSS.

As an example, we're using a simple Beanshell action and ROME for publishing a
simple RSS feed.

About ROME:
    ROME: RSS and Atom Utilities
    "...ending syndication feed confusion by supporting all of 'em. " *

    ROME is a set of Atom/RSS Java utilities that make it easy to work in Java with 
    most syndication formats:

        * RSS 0.90
        * RSS 0.91 Netscape
        * RSS 0.91 Userland
        * RSS 0.92
        * RSS 0.93
        * RSS 0.94
        * RSS 1.0
        * RSS 2.0
        * Atom 0.3
        * Atom 1.0 

    ROME includes a set of parsers and generators for the various flavors of syndication 
    feeds, as well as converters to convert from one format to another. The parsers can 
    give you back Java objects that are either specific for the format you want to 
    work with, or a generic normalized SyndFeed class that lets you work on with the data 
    without bothering about the incoming or outgoing feed type.
