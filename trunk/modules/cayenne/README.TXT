This is a JPublish module offering Cayenne support to any JPublish applications.

With a wealth of unique and powerful features, Cayenne can address a wide range of
persistence needs. Cayenne seamlessly binds one or more database schemas directly to
Java objects, managing atomic commit and rollbacks, SQL generation, joins,
sequences, and more. With Cayenne's Remote Object Persistence, those Java objects
can even be persisted out to clients via Web Services. Or, with native XML serialization,
objects can be even further persisted to non-Java clients - such as an Ajax-capable browser.
