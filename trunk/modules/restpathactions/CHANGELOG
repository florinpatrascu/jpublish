- cleaned up the demo app html code to explicitly use jQuery instead of '$'; was generating a Velocity error
- the RPA module will return a 404 if there are no matching routes (Thank you for catching it, Alejandro)
- typo in the ANT build, incorrectly generating 'respathactions' instead of 'restpathactions', sorry for that
