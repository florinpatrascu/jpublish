- added support for annotated REST resources via a JPublish Wink module; first release
- Apache Wink is a full implementation of the JAX-RS 1.0 specification, providing a rich set of
  features and expansions that extend and supplement the JAX-RS specification.
- added a couple of REST resources (non dynamic, though) and a demo JPublish application as an
  integration example.
