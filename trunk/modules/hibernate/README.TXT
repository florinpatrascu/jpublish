HIBERNATE: Relational Persistence for Java and .NET

Hibernate is a powerful, high performance object/relational persistence and query service.
Hibernate lets you develop persistent classes following object-oriented idiom - including
association, inheritance, polymorphism, composition, and collections. Hibernate allows you
to express queries in its own portable SQL extension (HQL), as well as in native SQL, or
with an object-oriented Criteria and Example API.
