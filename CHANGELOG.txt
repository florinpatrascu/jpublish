JPublish 4 change log:
[2009.04.28]
 - added few more default mime types
 - introduced the support for the "format" request parameter. The response.ContentType will
   follow the ?format=<xml|html|json|etc>, if the "format" parameter exists.

[2008.07.23]
 - JPublishDWR  Actions will receive now all of the traditional JPublish objects in the context:

    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_REQUEST
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_RESPONSE
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_SESSION
    JPublishCreator.APPLICATION
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_CHARACTER_ENCODING_MAP
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_URL_UTILITIES
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_DATE_UTILITIES
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_NUMBER_UTILITIES
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_SYSLOG
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_SITE

however, we are also cleaning the context so they are not accidentally sent to the remote caller.

- minor JPublishDWR revision number increased.
- added a simple example of how to invoke a JPublish server side Action from your Javascript
client code.


[2008.07.15]
-added code to allow profiling on DWR calls.
-our JPublishDWR integration is now allowing DWR to graciously falling back on jpublish's
own control for MIME types.

For example, to control the dwr/interface/... response, add the following to your jpublish.xml:
   <mime-mapping ext="js" mimetype="text/javascript"/>


[2008.05.05]
- removed the cache default configurations from the JPublish package. They may conflict with the
user ones. Copy the docs/cache/ehcache.xml and/or the docs/cache/whirlycache.xml to your WEB-INF/classes
folder in case you don't have a custom cache setup already.

[2008.03.06]
 - added the ability to use locale when parsing or formatting using DateUtilities

[2007.12.20]
- integrated profiling via the Atlassian profiling library
To enable the JPublish profiler, simply add the following line to the jpublish.xml config file:
   <profiling>true</profiling>
You can also set the minimum time reported in the trace when profiling. You probably only want to
profile methods that take more than 50ms, which is done like so:
   <profiling MIN_TIME="50">true</profiling>

[2007.10.31]
- the JPublishContext received by the Actions from the JPublishCreator contains now more useful
  objects. They are as follows:
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_REQUEST
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_RESPONSE
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_SESSION
    JPublishCreator.APPLICATION
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_CHARACTER_ENCODING_MAP
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_URL_UTILITIES
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_DATE_UTILITIES
    JPublishContext.JPUBLISH_NUMBER_UTILITIES
    JPublishCreator.DWR_CURRENT_PAGE

[2007.10.27]
- added functionality to allow DWR to invoke JPublish Actions. Check the simpleDWR
  web demo for a simple but complete example.

[2007.10.20]
- the current JPublishContext instance is now added to every HttpServletRequest.
  You can get it like this: request.getAttribute( JPublishServlet.JPUBLISH_CONTEXT);
- the SiteContext is now available in the ServletContext:
  ....getServletContext().getAttribute(SiteContext.NAME)
- added the public method getSiteContext() to the JPublishServlet.
 
[2007.10.13]
- The ORM support Wiki page was updated with details about the JPublish-Cayenne
  implementation: http://code.google.com/p/jpublish/wiki/OrmSupport

[2007.10.12]
- Cayenne support is now available to any JPublish application

[2007.08.25]
- added new rendering support through the StringTemplateViewRenderer. For
  more details visit the JPublish Wiki. We believe that ST will become the
  default template language for JPublish.
- wrapped the RepositoryWrapper in a Map, so modern template engines will
  have an easy job identifying the repository content resources as simple keys.
- small optimization
- preparing to branch the SVN

[2007.08.23]
- added a new DWR demo application. A simple and clean code showing you how one can
  monitor a file by using reverse AJAX through the DWR module.
- small optimizations and misc examples

[2007.05.28]
- WEB-INF/lib folder is not anymore required when JPublish is instantiated
  from an application different than a standard Servlet container.
- JPublish understands now how Jetty plays with the Continuations ;)
- latest PostEdenLib is now available in the lib folder
- added the latest bsh version
- DWR library is updated now and Reverse AJAX finally works with no problems.
- JP4+DWR is running successfully with the following servers: Jetty 5/6.1.3,
  Tomcat 5/6.0.13 and JBoss 4.0.2/4.0.5GA

[2007.05.20]
 - improving the JPublishComponent API in order to support
   the need for rendering a Text parameter or a View from a given path. Useful if
   you need to implement more complex Components but not as complex as a ViewRenderer.

Version 4.0 (2007.05.14)
 - Initial release
