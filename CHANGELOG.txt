JPublish 4 change log:

[2007.10.12]
- Cayenne support is now available to any JPublish application

[2007.08.25]
- added new rendering support through the StringTemplateViewRenderer. For
  more details visit the JPublish Wiki. We believe that ST will become the
  default template language for JPublish.
- wrapped the RepositoryWrapper in a Map, so modern template engines will
  have an easy job identifying the repository content resources as simple keys.
- small optimization
- preparing to branch the SVN

[2007.08.23]
- added a new DWR demo application. A simple and clean code showing you how one can
  monitor a file by using reverse AJAX through the DWR module.
- small optimizations and misc examples

[2007.05.28]
- WEB-INF/lib folder is not anymore required when JPublish is instantiated
  from an application different than a standard Servlet container.
- JPublish understands now how Jetty plays with the Continuations ;)
- latest PostEdenLib is now available in the lib folder
- added the latest bsh version
- DWR library is updated now and Reverse AJAX finally works with no problems.
- JP4+DWR is running successfully with the following servers: Jetty 5/6.1.3,
  Tomcat 5/6.0.13 and JBoss 4.0.2/4.0.5GA

[2007.05.20]
 - improving the JPublishComponent API in order to support
   the need for rendering a Text parameter or a View from a given path. Useful if
   you need to implement more complex Components but not as complex as a ViewRenderer.

Version 4.0 (2007.05.14)
 - Initial release
